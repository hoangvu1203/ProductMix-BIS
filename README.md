# ProductMix-BIS

A Business Intelligence system for **CompanyX** built using the **AdventureWorks** dataset. This project integrates ETL pipelines (SSIS), customer segmentation (Python clustering), and interactive dashboards (Power BI) to optimize product mix decisions and understand customer purchasing behavior.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The goal of this project is to deliver a complete Business Intelligence system for product mix analysis. It includes:

1. **Data Extraction & Loading**  
   Built with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to extract and load data from the AdventureWorks database into a structured data warehouse.

2. **Clustering & Analysis**  
   Python is used to perform customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior using K-Means clustering.

3. **Visualization**  
   Power BI dashboards provide actionable insights for business stakeholders on sales trends, product performance, and segment behavior.
